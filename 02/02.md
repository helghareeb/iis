---

## **📖 Lecture Contents**

### **1️⃣ What are Information System Processes?**
- A structured set of activities required to develop an **Information System (IS)**.
- **Common IS process activities:**
  1. **Specification** – Defining what the system should do.
  2. **Design & Implementation** – Organizing and developing the system.
  3. **Validation** – Ensuring the system meets requirements.
  4. **Evolution** – Updating the system based on new needs.

### **2️⃣ Information System Process Models**
- **Plan-Driven Approach:** Follows a strict sequence of steps.
- **Agile Approach:** Allows for flexibility and iterative changes.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both plan-driven and agile elements.

#### **Types of IS Process Models**
1. **Waterfall Model**  
   - Phased approach: Specification → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment  
   - **Limitations:** Difficult to accommodate change after the process starts.  
2. **Incremental Development**  
   - Specification, development, and validation are interleaved.  
   - **Advantages:** Faster feedback, early software delivery.  
3. **Reuse-Oriented Development**  
   - System is built from pre-existing components (e.g., APIs, open-source tools).  
   - **Challenges:** Requires adapting components to specific business needs.

### **3️⃣ Coping with Change in Information Systems**
- **Change is inevitable** due to evolving business needs and technologies.
- **Strategies to handle change:**
  - **Prototyping:** Build an early version of the system for feedback.
  - **Incremental Delivery:** Release parts of the system over time.
  - **Agile Development:** Adapt IS processes to be more flexible.

### **4️⃣ Introduction to Agile Development**
- Focuses on rapid development, **frequent releases**, and **minimized documentation**.
- **Key Agile Principles (Agile Manifesto):**
  - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
  - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
  - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
  - **Responding to change** over following a plan.

#### **Agile Methodologies**
1. **Scrum:** Organizes work into small iterations called **Sprints**.
2. **Extreme Programming (XP):** Encourages test-driven development.
3. **Kanban:** Visualizes workflow for continuous improvement.

### **5️⃣ Agile vs. Plan-Driven Development**
| Aspect         | Agile Development | Plan-Driven Development |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Approach     | Iterative, flexible | Predefined, structured |
| Requirements | Evolve over time | Fixed at the beginning |
| Documentation | Minimal, focused on working system | Comprehensive, detailed |
| Customer Involvement | High, frequent feedback | Limited, mostly initial phase |

### **6️⃣ Agile Project Management**
- **Roles in Agile Teams:**
  - **Product Owner:** Defines project goals.
  - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates agile practices.
  - **Development Team:** Implements system features.
- **Scrum Process:**
  - **Sprint Planning → Daily Stand-ups → Sprint Review → Retrospective**.
- **Challenges of Scaling Agile:**
  - Large organizations require multiple teams, cross-team collaboration, and documentation.

## **🔍 Case Study: Agile Development for Learning Management System (LMS)**

### **📌 Scenario**
An **LMS** is a platform used by educational institutions to manage courses, assignments, and student engagement. The university has decided to **adopt agile development** to improve the LMS quickly and efficiently.

### **📊 Key Features of Agile LMS Development**
1. **Frequent Releases:** New features every 2 weeks.
2. **User Involvement:** Teachers and students provide feedback after each sprint.
3. **Minimal Documentation:** Focus on working software.
4. **Automated Testing:** Ensures reliability with every update.

### **📌 Challenges**
- **Scalability:** Handling thousands of users.
- **Integration:** Connecting with external tools (Zoom, Google Drive).
- **Security:** Ensuring data protection and privacy.

### **📌 Agile Solutions**
- Using **Scrum Framework** to break work into **2-week sprints**.
- Implementing **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**.
- Conducting **regular user testing** for early feedback.

### **📌 Discussion Questions**
1. How does Agile development improve an LMS compared to traditional IS processes?
2. What challenges might arise when scaling Agile for large university systems?
3. How can Agile methodologies be used to **enhance collaboration** between students, teachers, and administrators?
