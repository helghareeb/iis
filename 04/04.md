## **📖 Lecture Contents**

### **1️⃣ Introduction to Requirements Engineering**
- **Definition:** The process of defining, documenting, and maintaining system requirements.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures that an **Information System (IS)** meets stakeholder needs and business objectives.  
- **Key Activities in Requirements Engineering:**  
  1. **Elicitation** – Gathering requirements.  
  2. **Specification** – Documenting requirements formally.  
  3. **Validation** – Ensuring requirements are correct and complete.  
  4. **Management** – Handling evolving requirements.  

---

### **2️⃣ Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**
#### **📌 Functional Requirements**
- Define what the system **must do**.
- Example:  
  - "The LMS should allow students to **submit assignments** before deadlines."
  - "The system should generate **daily attendance reports** for instructors."

#### **📌 Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
- Define system **constraints** (performance, security, usability).
- Example:  
  - "The system should support **5,000 concurrent users**."
  - "User login response time should be **under 2 seconds**."

| Type of Requirement | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Functional** | "Users should be able to register for courses online." |
| **Non-Functional** | "The system should be available 99.9% of the time." |

### **3️⃣ Requirements Elicitation Techniques**
- **Interviews:** Gathering insights from key stakeholders.  
- **Surveys & Questionnaires:** Collecting feedback from multiple users.  
- **Observation:** Studying how users interact with existing systems.  
- **Prototyping:** Building a sample system for early feedback.  
- **Focus Groups:** Brainstorming sessions with end-users.  

✅ **Challenge:**  
Stakeholders may have **conflicting** or **unclear** requirements.

✅ **Solution:**  
Using structured **elicitation techniques** ensures a clear understanding of business needs.

---

### **4️⃣ Requirements Specification**
- **Use Cases:** Describe system interactions from a user’s perspective.  
- **User Stories:** Short, simple descriptions of features.  
- **Process Models:** Diagrammatic representation of workflows.  

✅ **Example Use Case for an LMS:**  
- **Title:** "Student Course Enrollment"  
- **Actors:** Student, LMS System  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Student logs into the LMS.  
  2. Navigates to the course catalog.  
  3. Selects and enrolls in a course.  
  4. System confirms enrollment and updates records.  

---

### **5️⃣ Requirements Validation**
**Purpose:** Ensure requirements are **correct, complete, and feasible**.

- **Methods:**  
  ✅ **Reviews:** Stakeholders review documented requirements.  
  ✅ **Prototyping:** Validate if requirements align with user expectations.  
  ✅ **Test Cases:** Early test case design to check feasibility.

- **Key Validation Questions:**  
  1. Are all functional and non-functional requirements clearly defined?  
  2. Are there **conflicting requirements**?  
  3. Are all **user roles** accounted for?  
  4. Is there any **missing information**?  

---

### **6️⃣ Managing Changing Requirements**
**Why Do Requirements Change?**
1. Business priorities shift.  
2. New regulations or compliance updates.  
3. Emerging technologies.  

**Strategies for Handling Change:**
- **Traceability Matrices:** Track relationships between requirements.  
- **Version Control:** Maintain different versions of requirement documents.  
- **Agile Approach:** Incorporate flexibility for evolving requirements.  

✅ **Example:**  
A university **LMS** needs to add a **"Remote Proctoring"** feature due to increased online learning.  
Solution: Adapt requirements **without disrupting existing functionalities**.

## **🔍 Case Study: Requirements Engineering for a Learning Management System (LMS)**

### **📌 Scenario**
A university is developing an **LMS** to facilitate online learning. The IT department needs to gather system requirements from faculty, students, and administrators.

### **📊 Key Functional Requirements**
1. **Course Management:** Instructors should be able to create and update courses.  
2. **Student Enrollment:** Students can register for and drop courses online.  
3. **Assignment Submission:** Students should submit assignments through the system.  
4. **Grading System:** Instructors should grade assignments and provide feedback.

### **📊 Key Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Scalability:** The system must support **10,000 concurrent users**.  
2. **Security:** **Two-factor authentication** is required for all users.  
3. **Performance:** Pages must load within **2 seconds**.  
4. **Availability:** The LMS should have **99.9% uptime**.

### **📌 Challenges**
